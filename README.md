# Evidence-2

I would like to start by expressing my sincere thanks for your support and dedication throughout the learning process. Undoubtedly, it has been a challenge for me to understand the concepts and skills needed to program. However, your patience and didactic approach have been fundamental to my progress.

I confess that, at first, I felt overwhelmed and struggled to understand how to apply programming logic to problem solving. But thanks to his clear explanations, practical examples and challenging exercises, I gradually began to feel more comfortable and confident in the world of programming.

Although my academic interests and goals lean more towards the field of finance, I realized that the contents we addressed, such as Linear Programming and Forecasting, have significant value and relevance in this field as well. I am convinced that the ability to analyze data, identify patterns and make informed decisions will be crucial skills in my future as a finance professional.

In summary, I want to express my deepest appreciation for your guidance, patience and for sharing your knowledge in a clear and accessible manner. I am confident that the skills I have acquired during this course, including programming, will be a solid foundation for my personal and professional growth.

Thank you, professor, for your commitment and for opening new horizons in my educational path.
